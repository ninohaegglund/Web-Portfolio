  <h1>About Me👋</h1>
    <div class="aboutme-text">

      <p>Hello! My name is Nino, an aspiring web developer with a keen eye for design. 
      I believe in creating websites that are not only functionally efficient but also aesthetically pleasing. 
      To me, a great website is one that marries form and function to create a seamless, engaging user experience.
      </p>
    
      <p>I'm passionate about all aspects of web development, from the nitty-gritty of coding to the creative 
      process of designing the user interface. I strive to build websites that are modern, user-friendly, 
      easy to navigate, and visually appealing. I take pride in my attention to detail and my ability to 
      create designs that are both beautiful and intuitive.</p>
    
      <p>Currently, I'm honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and exploring the latest design 
      trends and techniques to keep my creations fresh and relevant. I love the challenge of translating a 
      design vision into a fully functional website that looks good on any device.</p>
    
      <p>When I'm not coding or experimenting with design, you can find me at the gym, practising my piano skills, catching up on the 
        latest tech trends or gaming with friends. I'm excited to bring 
        my unique blend of coding and design skills to your team, and I look forward to creating web 
        solutions that are not only effective but also visually captivating. Let's connect!
      </p>
